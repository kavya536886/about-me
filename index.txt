Hi, I am Kavya and I come from Hyderabad, India. I have done my under-graduate course in Computer Science. I had a good amount of practical and real time exposure that I gained during my course in under graduate program. 
I was then on a look out for a program that will give me further practical, hands on experience with the latest cutting edge technologies before I get on to start my job. That's exactly when I came across this program in "Applied Computer Science" at NWMSU. It was a pleasant surprise to discover that the courses offered here and the curriculum match to a great extent with what I have always wanted to further my knowledge in after my undergraduate program. 
Apart from the regular curricular activities I have been a part of national level hackathon and took an active part in technical fests. With an extremely practical structure of my current course at NWMSU I am very optimistic of expanding the horizons of the knowledge required for the current job world and be a good value add to the organisation I get into.
